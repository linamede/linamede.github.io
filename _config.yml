  Hi, my name is Paschalina Medentzidou and I am a machine learning engineer. I am currently working for the Information Technologies Institute. I enjoy extracting meaningful information from raw multimedia data and continuously learning new technologies on how to do that. 
  
  Working on security related projects I implement methods for object detection and motion based multiple object tracking using Deep Neural Networks. I get exposed to a series of machine learning frameworks (<mark>Caffe</mark>, <mark>Keras</mark>, <mark>Torch</mark>),  programming languages (<mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Matlab</mark>, <mark>Lua</mark>), and  technologies (<mark>MongoDB</mark> , <mark>Docker</mark> , <mark>Git Version Control</mark>). The fact that I am working on technologies that can make people's lives better makes each day at work count for me!

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
