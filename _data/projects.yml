    Enriching 360 media with 3D storytelling and personalization elements
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
   The end-goal of Hyper360 is to develop an enriched 360o media production toolset capable of delivering compelling personalized and interactive viewing experiences. 
   This toolset will enable content distributors to deliver these media through broadband (OTT) to a variety of platforms. 
   To this intend, existing work and technologies among the consortium members (360o video – DRK/FOKUS, personalization engine – FOKUS/CERTH, 3D capture – CERTH) 
   will be adapted and extended by their respective IP owners while being evaluated for integration (ENG), with expertise in the fields of image processing (FOKUS/CERTH)
   and video quality analysis (JRS) utilized to design and create the required technological components to complete the proposed production solution, namely the 360o/3D fusion and emplacement technology (CERTH) and the online produced content quality analysis (JRS).
